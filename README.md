## WHAT IS THIS?

This library contains functionality for easy connection
to different types of relational databases with support
for synchronous and asynchronous query types.


The whole concept of JNoQuery is divided into several
modules created for different technical solutions, namely:

* **JDBC**: Owns direct connection via URL formats, and also supports many previously known types of relational databases:
    * H2;
    * MySQL;
    * MariaDB;
    * SQLite;
    * ClickHouse;
    * PostgreSQL;
    * *etc.*

<br>

* **NoSQL**: This type of technology makes it possible to create queries based on building on a builder pattern;

<br>

* **ORM**:This technology allows you to manipulate the database with any Java objects in general, while maintaining the ability to perform all the same familiar queries.
